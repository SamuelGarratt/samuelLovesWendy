<h1>What we've done</h1>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>
We spent a lot of long nights together, haha. I drove back to Wellington many times from Palmy. Probably when you really wanted to 
stay in Palmy but needed to work. So sad.. :(
</p>

<h3>Dates</h3>
<p>
On our first walk together we walked outside your house. It was probably a bit awkward at the time as we did not know each other that
well. We talked about serving together, other spiritual things and Daniel came up with your dog. Lol. But I had been praying a lot
before that time and I felt very peaceful at that time and felt afterwards that it was confirmation from the Lord that you were the one. <br>
The second date I came to Wellington and we went to Botanical gardens. I felt it was sweet walking and talking together. 
</p>
<p>
Another time we went for a walk by the foxton beach. It was a looong walk. Sorry about that. I talked about my history (and was probably too spiritual). Good exercise.
All these little times we got to know one another better.
</p>
<p>
We went to Shannon and learned about owls and other animals lol. I thought it was interesting. I was trying to keep it a secret but wasn't that good at it.

<h2>Early marriage before baby</h2>
<p>
We settled into our house on the Terrace. You helped me find a job and we celebrated when I finally got work. Yay! I supported you 
while you did some study. We continued being nerdy together. Then we thought we'd try and have a baby (usually takes a while right. lol)
