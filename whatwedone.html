        <h1>What we've done</h1>
        <h2>Courtship</h2>
        <p>
            We spent a lot of long nights together, haha. I drove back to Wellington many times from Palmy. Probably when you really wanted to 
            stay in Palmy but needed to work. So sad.. :(
        </p>

            <h3>Dates</h3>
            <p>
                On our first walk together we walked outside your house. It was probably a bit awkward at the time as we did not know each other that
                well. We talked about serving together, other spiritual things and Daniel came up with your dog. Lol. But I had been praying a lot
                before that time and I felt very peaceful at that time and felt afterwards that it was confirmation from the Lord that you were the one. <br>
                The second date I came to Wellington and we went to Botanical gardens. I felt it was sweet walking and talking together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another time we went for a walk by the foxton beach. It was a looong walk. Sorry about that. I talked about my history (and was probably too spiritual). Good exercise.
                All these little times we got to know one another better.
            </p>
            <p>
                We went to Shannon and learned about owls and other animals lol. I thought it was interesting. I was trying to keep it a secret but wasn't that good at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had many many car journeys together from Palmy to Wellington. Taking a ride with me was much better than the bus. We stayed up late and many walks beside the beautiful Wellington water front.

        <h2>Early marriage before baby</h2>
        <p>
            We settled into our house on the Terrace. You helped me find a job and we celebrated when I finally got work. Yay! I supported you while you did some study. We continued being nerdy together. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Work and study was hard for you. Must have been mentally straining. Then we experienced being robbed in Auckland and losing all our stuff. It was a horrible experience yet through this we learned to care for one another more and became closer.
        </p>
        <p>
On my birthday you treated me with an exciting treasure hunt. It took me a while but I eventually got to see my present, an iPhone 6. I couldn't believe it. Thank u dear.
        </p><p>
Then we thought we'd try and have a baby (usually takes a while right. lol) It seemed as soon as we tried for a baby, 'boom' she came. She must have been impatiently waiting. I enjoyed your cravings for sweet and salty things as we ate lots of things together. It seemed to my delight, you suddenly liked cheese.
        </p><p>
We became worried as she grew yet became overdue. Fortunately your parents were there for support. The lots of walking, chiropractor, etc didn't work. Acacia was too comfy in your belly.
        </p><p>
And so induction day came. It was a nerve racking experience. A long day. We walked up the stairs together. You'd probably never walked so much in a short time before.
