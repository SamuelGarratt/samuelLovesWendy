        <h1>What we've done</h1>
        <h2>Courtship</h2>
        <p>
            We spent a lot of long nights together, haha. I drove back to Wellington many times from Palmy. Probably when you really wanted to 
            stay in Palmy but needed to work. So sad.. :(
        </p>

            <h3>Dates</h3>
            <p>
                On our first walk together we walked outside your house. It was probably a bit awkward at the time as we did not know each other that
                well. We talked about serving together, other spiritual things and Daniel came up with your dog. Lol. But I had been praying a lot
                before that time and I felt very peaceful at that time and felt afterwards that it was confirmation from the Lord that you were the one. <br>
                The second date I came to Wellington and we went to Botanical gardens. I felt it was sweet walking and talking together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another time we went for a walk by the foxton beach. It was a looong walk. Sorry about that. I talked about my history (and was probably too spiritual). Good exercise.
                All these little times we got to know one another better.
            </p>
            <p>
                We went to Shannon and learned about owls and other animals lol. I thought it was interesting. I was trying to keep it a secret but wasn't that good at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had many many car journeys together from Palmy to Wellington. Taking a ride with me was much better than the bus. We stayed up late and many walks beside the beautiful Wellington water front.

        <h2>Early marriage before baby</h2>
        <p>
            We settled into our house on the Terrace. You helped me find a job and we celebrated when I finally got work. Yay! I supported you while you did some study. We continued being nerdy together. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Work and study was hard for you. Must have been mentally straining. Then we experienced being robbed in Auckland and losing all our stuff. It was a horrible experience yet through this we learned to care for one another more and became closer.
        </p>
        <p>
On my birthday you treated me with an exciting treasure hunt. It took me a while but I eventually got to see my present, an iPhone 6. I couldn't believe it. Thank u dear.
        </p><p>
Then we thought we'd try and have a baby (usually takes a while right. lol) It seemed as soon as we tried for a baby, 'boom' she came. She must have been impatiently waiting. I enjoyed your cravings for sweet and salty things as we ate lots of things together. It seemed to my delight, you suddenly liked cheese.
        </p><p>
We became worried as she grew yet became overdue. Fortunately your parents were there for support. The lots of walking, chiropractor, etc didn't work. Acacia was too comfy in your belly.
        </p><p>
And so induction day came. It was a nerve racking experience. A long day. We walked up the stairs together. You'd probably never walked so much in a short time before. After several hours you got epidural. I'm really happy you did in the end. It made the pain so much less and it made the C section later much easier. Thank you Lord.
        </p>
        <h2>Baby arrived </h2>

After Acacia was born we were all so busy. After a few nights she became really fussy. We all took turns rocking her to sleep. Early on I made the mistake of holding her while lying on the couch. That was her 1st visit out after we arrived home. :( Not the nicest reason to go out.

Anyway she drank well and grew bigger and chubbier day by day. You must have had a great milk supply. 

Gradually as she got older, we were able to take her out more. Out to more meetings, park, waterfront, etc. initially the bugaboo didn't seem so appealing to her but over time it became invaluable, especially once she could sit up in it.

She's been attached to us so we've had to accommodate her by having her sleep next to you, it worked for us. 

<h2>What she's learnt</h2>

She's learned to smile, giggle and complain a lot. She can roll over, hold and eat solid food. 

<h2>New house </h2>

Then came the house. Wow it was fast. We just put in 1 offer and we got it. I really feel like it was the Lord's provision. I hope we can be faithful to Him to raise up a testimony here. 

There's so much more space. We can actually spread out. Neighbours are so nice, so willing to help. 

<h2>New Car</h2>
This has given you freedom at our new place. You're now mobile and can transport others too. I'm glad this has allowed you to become free from being stuck inside.

<h2>New hard drive</h2>
This is small but necessary since we are getting so many photos and videos of Acacia.
