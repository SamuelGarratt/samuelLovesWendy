<h1>What we've done</h1>
<h2>Courtship</h2>
<p>
We spent a lot of long nights together, haha. I drove back to Wellington many times from Palmy. Probably when you really wanted to 
stay in Palmy but needed to work. So sad.. :(
</p>
<p>
We went to Shannon and learned about owls and other animals lol.
</p>
<h2>Early marriage before baby</h2>
<p>
We settled into our house on the Terrace. You helped me find a job and we celebrated when I finally got work. Yay! I supported you 
while you did some study. We continued being nerdy together. Then we thought we'd try and have a baby (usually takes a while right. lol)
